She claims that the treats were improperly manufactured and lacked a clear expiration date, leading to the development of harmful toxins. Ms. Capella is seeking compensation for Sally's market value as a show dog, veterinary expenses, and emotional distress. </p><p>Petzicon denies these allegations, asserting that their products are rigorously tested and safe when consumed before the recommended date.
